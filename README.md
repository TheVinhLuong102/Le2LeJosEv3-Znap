# Le2LeJosEv3-Znap
This is the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 **Znap Robot** example program in the Java programming language that uses a Java Implementation of _LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Programming Blocks (icons)_ on LeJOS EV3. 

You can find the building instructions and the LEGO icon-based program of the _Znap Robot_ in the LEGO速 icon based (LabView-based) Programming Environment (Education Edition).
The Znap Robot is one of the Expansion Set Models.
You can download the LEGO速 Programming Environment at https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3/software (or one of the other language pages).

## Dependencies
This project depends on the **Le2LeJosEv3** Library (see https://github.com/robl0377/Le2LeJosEv3) that sits on top of the current version of the LeJOS EV3 framework. 
Please add the JAR file of the _Le2LeJosEv3_ Library _(le2lejosev3.jar)_ into this project's classpath before running it. The LeJOS Eclipse plugin will take care of the transfer of the library and the program JAR files to the EV3 brick..

In this project I am using the **LeJOS EV3 v0.9.1beta** framework (see https://sourceforge.net/projects/ev3.lejos.p/) and a standard LEGO速 Mindstorms EV3 Brick.

## Resources
The program uses several sound files that are in the project's _resources_ directory. 
Please upload them to your EV3 Brick via SCP to the directory _/home/lejos/lib_.

The **sound files** are converted from those MP3 sound files found at www.thumb.com.tw/images/blog/lego_ev3_sound_files/ev3_sounds.zip.
There are several ways to convert the MP3 sound files to WAV. 
I was using the online converter at https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-wav. 
Be sure to set _Change audio channels:_ to _mono_.
